# Duct_Calculator
A duct sizer GUI that allows the user to evaluate the performance of air ducts at chosen airflows, shapes, and sizes.
The calculations for pressure drop are based on the Darcy-Weisbach equation. A numerical method solves for the friction factor in the Colebrook-White equation.
Air properties are taken at standard conditions, but could be modified if desired.
